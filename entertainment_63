SNL vs. 'Star Wars': The Force Awakens ... and has a senior moment

In the Star Wars universe, we’ve heard of Imperial Walkers. Now, we have lightsaber walkers.
There was no footage of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher or any of other veteran characters in the trailer for Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but Saturday Night Live decided to remedy that last night by giving us its own look at the aging stars of the franchise, 30-plus years after Return of the Jedi.
Adding to the countless spoofs, recreations, and satires that have already hit the web, SNL gives us a doddering Han Solo (Taran Killam) blurting out orders at the Mos Eisley cantina like its an intergalactic Denny’s, Chewy looking like his most recent trips to the vet aren’t going so well, and a Millennium Falcon that can now secure the easy-to-access parking spaces after making the Kessel Run.
There’s also Bobby Moynihan as Princess Leia (seriously, though, SNL … There’s one woman from the original trilogy and a guy has to play this part?) struggling to figure out some common household technology, and host James Franco as a cave-dwelling Luke Skywalker, who’s still putting that Yoda levitation training to good use.
