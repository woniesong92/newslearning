Tons of ice running off in Amundsen sea alarms Climatologists


A research made on the ice runoffs in west Antarctica is alarming to the climatologists.

The research study became the part of the Geophysical Research Letter journal. The study involves the readings taken from the four satellites which recorded the loss of ice from 1992 to 2013. The readings were alarming as they showed the loss of ice equivalent to the size of Mount Everest, Every year.

The loss of 83 billion tons of ice into the embayment of Amundsen Sea from the region of west Antarctica is indeed distressing said by Isabella Velicogna, a scientist from NASA and the co author of this study. “The loss of glaciers at such a pace is alarming” she added.

The research also highlighted the event of shattering of an ice berg of a size greater than the size of Australian Capital Territory in 2002 due to the rise in temperature and increase in rainfall. Such an immense melting in the region of western Antarctica will seriously be creating a big impact on the rise in sea level.

According to the Boffins this rising of melting at this rate is reversible at this point and if this melting continues, it would put an increment of around 3 feet in the sea level in next 200 years.

According to the glaciologist of University of California, Eric Rignot says that at this point the 200 years might be a figure that seems too far from now but the retrieval of ice sheets at this pace would add up colossal amount of water in the environment which will be disastrous to the habitats living on the coastal areas.

Boffins that believe that the East Antarctica is gaining ice deny the climatic change and the crisis related, but in fact according to the stats the loss of ice in western region is quite greater than the amount added to the eastern region. So the ice gain in eastern Antarctica is irrelevant in this subject.
