James Franco Laughs Off Massive Sony Hack On 'SNL'

James Franco hosted Saturday Night Live for his third time last night, but this time, his monologue featured a couple of controversies that hit him close to home.

In his opening monologue, the actor brought up the Sony hack. Sony is the studio behind his latest movie, The Interview. 

The movie's plot about assassinating North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un was a speculated reason as to why North Korea would have retaliated by hacking the studio's computers, but the Washington Post reported today that North Korea has denied the hacking. 

Franco, said, "This week Sony got all their computers hacked. This is true. These hackers have leaked real person information about everybody that works with Sony. Social security numbers, emails, and I know eventually they’re going to be leaking stuff about me."

The 36-year-old made light of the breach of security saying that soon we'll know his email is "CuterThanDaveFranco@AOL.com" and that his password is  "LittleJamesyCutiePie."

Beyond the jokes though, he mentioned an all too familiar incident when his costar from The Interview Seth Rogen joined him to tell him that they also released their private photos.

Franco took this opportunity to say, "All the girls who got any Instagram messages from me this year, last year, the hackers did it. It was the hackers!"

Back in April, Franco was part of an Instagram scandal where photos and screencaps of his alleged conversation with a 17-year –old Scottish student surfaced.

He went on Live! with Kelly and Michael on April 4 to say, "I'm embarrassed, and I guess I'm just a model of how, you know, how social media is tricky, I used bad judgment. I learned my lesson."
