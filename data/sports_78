Garry Monk says the performance from his Swansea side in the 3-1 defeat at West Ham was the worst he had seen in some time.

Wilfried Bony got Swansea off to a great start when he fired home the opening goal on 19 minutes, but the home side hit back thanks to a brace from Andy Carroll and a late strike from Diafra Sakho.

Goalkeeper Lucasz Fabianski was also sent off to cap a miserable afternoon for Monk's side, who have won just one game on the road this season.

"I just don't think we ever reached the levels we have done this season," he said. "That is the first time I can say that, in all the games we have played. We did not make enough correct decisions. The only time we did that we scored the goal.

"We didn't do that enough and really some of the defending, we gifted it to them on a plate to be honest. No complaints with the result, we didn't deserve anything from the game.

"We actually had our best spell when we went down to 10 men but it shouldn't take a situation like that for us to play our best football. We gave them an early Christmas present I think."
