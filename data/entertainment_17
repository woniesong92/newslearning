According to TMZ, the incident occurred near Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles around 9.30pm on Thursday evening.

Brian is thought to have been driving a Range Rover when a Mini Cooper going the opposite way crossed over the yellow line, sideswiping them. According to the website, the Mini Cooper blew a tire and spun around, eventually stopping.

Brian reportedly called the police, who arrested a 35-year-old man who sources say was twice the legal limit.

Luckily, Megan and Brian weren't hurt and it seems their children Noah and Bodhi weren't in the vehicle at the time.

Megan (28) recently spoke out about how much her life has changed since having kids with her 41-year-old husband.

The former Transformers heroine and her Desperate Housewives star husband are rarely seen at red carpet events or exclusive Hollywood bashes since Megan welcomed her second child earlier this year.

"Yeah, it's made me so much more aware. You start asking all these questions - what is the purpose of this soul, and why did you choose me to be his mother? - that you didn't when you were younger, because they just weren't that important to you," she explained to the US edition of OK! magazine. "The only thing I'm worried about now is making sure my children are safe and happy. That's my biggest fear, every moment of every day."
