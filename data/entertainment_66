 Diane von Furstenberg Arrives at Destroyed Home: "I Am Not Happy"â€”See the Tense House of DVF Clip!

 The Brand Ambassador candidates may have thought that they could get away with throwing a little house party in The Hamptons, but it was only a matter of time before Diane Von Furstenberg found out! Turns out, when you post party pictures on social media, they're not that hard to access...
In this clip from Sunday's episode of House of DVF, the girls are busy cleaning the house when all of a sudden, Diane shows up!
"I heard that you had a party," she says. "I have to tell you, I am not happy."

"I have this thing that now I just feel like an idiot and that I'm wasting time," she continues. "I just think that maybe this whole thing was not a good idea. This job, I'm not sure if I will give it to any of you at this point."
Watch the above clip to see what the girls have to say for themselves and tune-in to House of DVF this Sunday to find out if Diane will cancel the entire thing! 
Tune-in to an all-new episode of House of DVF this Sunday at 10/9c on E!
