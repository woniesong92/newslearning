Wishfull Thinking¡¯s jumping wins the day at Huntingdon in Grade Two Peterborough Chase

This continued the excellent form of jockey Richard Johnson and trainer Philip Hobbs.

Eduard looked a threat ¡©turning for home and Nicky Richards¡¯ horse took up the running ¡©between the last two fences.

However, a poor jump at the last allowed Wishfull Thinking to regain the lead and he had one-and-a-half lengths in hand at the line with Wonderful Charm in third.

¡°This is a horse that stays very well and he gave it 110 per cent,¡± said Johnson.

¡°He jumped lovely here and I think he is as well as he¡¯s ever been, despite being 11. He¡¯s so much more relaxed.¡±

Sarah Hobbs, wife of the winning trainer, said: ¡°Richard did say that the wind was a problem and the ground was tacky but he coped with it and he¡¯s so brave.¡±

Richards was left to rue the mistake at the last fence by Eduard, feeling it had cost him the race.

He said: ¡°I don¡¯t think there will be many people on the racecourse who would disagree that he would probably have won if he had gone and jumped the last a bit better.

¡°The race has been won by a grand horse, but ours is a young horse and if he¡¯d winged the last he¡¯d have won it for me.¡±

Over at Punchestown the Gordon Elliott-trained Don Cossack proved too strong for Boston Bob in the Grade One John Durkan Memorial Chase.

¡°It wasn¡¯t ideal with the loose horses and we were left in front early and my lad wasn¡¯t doing a lot in front,¡± said winning jockey Brian O¡¯Connell.

¡°There were some big shadows on the fences down the back which was a bit daunting for him but he was very good.¡±
