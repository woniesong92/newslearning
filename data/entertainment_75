Chris Brown Announces He's Single, Mingles With Khloé Kardashian, Kendall Jenner & Kylie Jenner—See the Photo!

Chris Brown is single and ready to mingle!
The 25-year-old R&B star had performed at Power 106's 2014 Cali Christmas concert in Los Angeles and was joined on stage by Kid Ink, Trey Songz and Tyga. The latter two are touring with him in 2015.
Brown, who was most recently linked to on-again, off-again girlfriend and model Karrueche Tran, 26, announced at the concert, in front of a cheering audience, that he is off the market.
"How many single ladies we got in here tonight?" he asked. 
He then paced across the stage silently for 15 seconds.
"Well, I'm single too," he said. "F--k that bitch!"
Brown did not name Tran and she has not responded directly to him. On Friday night, she did, however, post a tweet about men's behavior after breakups (warning: contains offensive language).
The two dated for years before breaking up this past summer. They were then spotted together again, looking cozy, weeks later.

That night, Brown hung out with Keeping Up With the Kardashian stars Khloé Kardashian, 30, and sisters Kendall Jenner, 19, and Kylie Jenner, 17, as seen in an Instagram photo posted on Khloe and Kylie's pages. Kendall is seen half-sitting on the singer's lap.
Other performers at the 2014 Cali Christmas concert included rapper T.I. and fellow hip hop artist French Montana, Kardashian's ex. It is unclear if the two interacted at the event. The two recently broke up for the second time after dating on and off for the past few months, E! News had learned on Friday.
At the concert, Kardashian rocked a cropped red plaid jacket and black skinny jeans tucked into knee-high boots. Kendall wore a gray tank top and tight, leather pants, while sister Kylie sported a  black leather jacket over a dark top and blue jeans.
