Reports: Liverpool consider offering Mario Balotelli to Napoli as part of Gonzalo Higuain bid

Liverpool could offer Mario Balotelli to Napoli as part of their efforts to bring ¡Ì30 million rated Gonzalo Higuain to Anfield, reports the Daily Mail.

Balotelli only joined Liverpool from AC Milan for ¡Ì16 million this summer, but the Italy international has been a major disappointment so far. He has yet to score in the Premier League for the Reds, and his perceived lack of application has been heavily criticised. He has also been injured recently, and he hasn¡¯t played since the 2-1 defeat against Chelsea last month.

Brendan Rodgers adamant Mario Balotelli has a future at Liverpool

His struggles have contributed to Liverpool¡¯s poor start to the season, and while they began the campaign with ambitions of a top four place, Brendan Rodger¡¯s side are currently in ninth-place after winning picking up 21 points from fifteen league games.

In addition to Balotelli, the club spent heavily during the summer to bring in eight more players, but none of the new signings have established themselves in the first team yet.

Rodgers is expected to try and strengthen again when the transfer window opens in January, and Higuain is viewed as someone who can bring much-needed firepower to the Liverpool attack.

Napoli value the Argentina international, who has also been linked with Arsenal, at around ¡Ì30 million. However, that price could come down if they can convince Napoli to Balotelli back to Serie A as part of the deal.
