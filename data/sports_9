Brook Lopez out at least a week with lower back strainThe Brooklyn Nets announced that center Brook Lopez underwent an MRI that revealed a lower back strain. He¡¯s out at least a week, at which time he will be re-evaluated.

It¡¯s been a rough few years for Lopez, health-wise. His last healthy season was 2012-13, when he played 74 games, but overall has missed 134 of 230 games of the last three seasons, which doesn¡¯t even count the current season, where he¡¯s missed two games already and will miss at least the next four with this injury.

When he¡¯s played, Lopez has averaged 16.1 points, 6.2 rebounds and 1.7 blocks per game, but he has struggled to win the favor of head coach Lionel Hollins, and the Nets are 8-10 on the season so far.
