Roberto Orci Responds To His Rumored Script & Directorial Departure From STAR TREK 3

Ever since Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness co-screenwriter Roberto Orci stepped down as director for the tentatively-titled Star Trek 3 sequel, rumors have been flooding the internet claiming to have knowledge of the situation. The unverified reports have attempted to answer the reason why he's producing the third installment instead and what the latest draft of his script co-written with Patrick McKay and J.D. Payne was supposedly about.

After the news broke on Star Trek fansite TrekMovie.com, the would-have-been director paid a visit and made a few comments under the username "boborci", a site he previously commented on. Four of his responses indicate he is still just as "excited" to bring Kirk and the rest of the Enterprise on their next intergalactic, deep space adventure.

"203. boborci - December 6, 2014

I will be very involved:)"


"206. boborci - December 6, 2014

185. not at all. still excited to makeTrek 3! And on time. We’ll find the right director!"


As for the purported script:

"208. boborci - December 6, 2014

no time travel was ever considered, fyi"


One user called OneBuckFilms even told him "You seem to have forgotten Kirk’s advice to Picard: “Don’t let them do ANYTHING to take you out of that chairs [sic]. Because while you’re there, you can make a difference.” to which Orci replied:

"444. Boborci - December 7, 2014

428. Have not forgotten. On the contrary, factored into decision. Their are bigger chairs to consider"


And in case you doubt these comments as coming from Orci himself, check out what one of the posts say:

"453. Brian Drew - December 7, 2014

That is indeed Bob. We accept no imitations here at TrekMovie ;-)."

Star Trek 3 will boldly go where no man has one before possibly in time for the franchise's 50th Anniversary in 2016.
