Sparks Fly as Ariana Grande and Big Sean Get Grabby During Sexy Jingle Ball Performanceâ€”Watch!

Let's just call Ariana Grande and Big Sean showstoppers!
Things got pretty steamy onstage Friday night when the young Hollywood couple surprised fans with a duet performance of "Best Mistake" at KIISFM's Jingle Ball.
Halfway through Grande's set, the now Grammy-nominated singer invited her boyfriend to perform "one of my favorite songs." What came next was a sexy number that proved these two are still going strong.
In video captured by KIISFM, the two singers get extra close as they finish the lyrics to their hit single.
As Big Sean grabs his girlfriend's waist (or dare we say butt), he leans in for a kiss. But Grande innocently turns her head the other way. Aww, young love.

According to an eyewitness, the two immediately snuck offstage for a quick kiss in private before Grande returned to perform "Bang Bang" with Jessie J.
"Thank u! @1027KIISFM #iHeartRadio," she tweeted after performing in front of a sold-out crowd at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. "#jingleball love u."
What's pretty impressive is that fact that Big Sean had to perform a set of his own at a totally different concert the same night. That's right, the 26-year-old traveled to The Forum in Inglewood, Calif., to be apart of Power 106's Cali Christmas.

After months of speculation, Grande finally confirmed she was dating the rapper during an October interview with Telegraph magazine.
When asked about her relationship status, the "Break Free" singer couldn't hide her love for a special someone.
"He is one of the most amazing men in the world, and that includes my grandfather and my brother," Grande shared when asked about Big Sean. "I think the world of him, and he's an amazing person. That's kind of all there is to it."
