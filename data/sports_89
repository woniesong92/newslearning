
Lineker criticises 'disgusting' Arsenal fans


You may have seen it by now, the video of Arsenal fans jeering and shouting at Arsene Wenger after the Stoke game.

This was not from the stands at the Britannia, but at Stoke-on-Trent train station, with fans insulting Wenger to his face from just two yards away.

It was an outpouring of vitriol which showed the real frustrations sections of fans have with the Frenchman, but also in the view of many crossed the line into being unacceptable abuse of the manager.

Match of the Day host Gary Lineke was one who felt this way, condemning those involved.


Fans are frustrated with Wenger after his side's woeful start to the season, which has them outside the top four and 13 points behind leaders Chelsea.

The club are paying the price for the manager's mistakes in the summer transfer market not to sign an experienced defender, or a defensive midfielder - while his team selection at times baffles.

Considering all he has achieved at Arsenal however, the personal abuse he received to his face easily oversteps the line.  Wenger will likely have been shaken up by the episode, and if he did walk away - who could really blame him?
