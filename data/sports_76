Hammers nail Swans to go third
West Ham striker Andy Carroll scored his first goals since March as the Hammers came from behind to beat Swansea City 3-1 yesterday and claim third place in the Barclays Premier League.

Wilfried Bony put Swansea ahead, but Carroll, who missed the first three months of the season with an ankle injury, scored twice before teeing up substitute Diafra Sakho to lash in a late third.

Swansea finished the game with 10 men after goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski was shown a straight red card for impeding Sakho shortly after Carroll's second goal.

The victory took Sam Allardyce's side up to third place, their highest position since 1999.

Swansea, who have gone 58 years without a league win at Upton Park, stay eighth.

West Ham started with Carroll and Enner Valencia in attack for the first time and they dominated the early stages, with Kevin Nolan obliging Fabianski to save from Stewart Downing's free kick.

Swansea struck in the 19th minute. Gylfi Sigurdsson pulled the ball back from the byline for Bony to steer home his seventh goal of the campaign.

The hosts equalised in the 41st minute. Carl Jenkinson whipped in a cross to the far post and Carroll climbed highest to guide a fine header into the top-right corner.

Then a two-minute spell midway through the second half tipped the momentum in West Ham's favour.

Carroll put the hosts ahead in the 66th minute, meeting Downing's drilled corner with a powerful header.

Sakho made no mistake three minutes from time to make it 3-1 when he gathered a flick-on from Carroll to blast the ball into the Swansea net for his seventh league goal of the season.
