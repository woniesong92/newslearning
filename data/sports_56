Bleacher Report's Complete 2014 MLB Winter Meetings Preview, Predictions

If you're a baseball fan, the next week is going to be fun and filled with all kinds of action, including rumors and speculation, as well as, yes, at least a few actual trades and signings.

That's because the annual winter meetings start up Sunday, Dec. 7 and carry on through Thursday, Dec. 11. This year, they're being held in San Diego, which is a pretty perfect getaway in the middle of winter (or, you know, any time of year).

While the meetings themselves have a number of business- and administrative-related events on the agenda, it's also an excuse to get general managers, front-office execs and representatives from all 30 clubs in the same spot for a handful of days.

That tends to bring about activity?or, at least, the potential for it.

"The ratio of talk to action will be about 50 to one," Chicago Cubs president Theo Epstein said, via Phil Rogers of MLB.com.

Still, something is bound to happen.

In advance of the meetings last year, the biggest news was the Seattle Mariners' surprise signing of Robinson Cano to a 10-year, $240 million contract. The fallout and impact of that spilled over into the actual meetings.

This year, the New York Yankees are in that position, having just traded for shortstop Didi Gregorius and signed lefty reliever Andrew Miller for $36 million over four years?doubling the largest amount ever awarded to a pitcher with no closing experience.

There's plenty more still to come, so here's a look at what might happen at the meetings based on the remaining free agents, trade candidates, team needs and the latest chatter.
