The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' Brandi Glanville: "My Boyfriend Just Broke Up With Me Via Email"

Ouch...this one may sound familiar for a lot of people who have had their hearts broken...
Brandi Glanville, a cast member on Bravo's The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and a mother of two, says a man she was dating ended their relationship and did so in a rather impersonal manner and for a very heartbreaking reason.
"My boyfriend just broke up with me via email because I said my kids will always be my first priority...NYC here I come," she tweeted on Saturday.
The 42-year-old reality star and former model shares two sons with ex-husband and actorEddie Cibrian, who wed singer LeAnn Rimes in 2011. She did not name her now-ex-boyfriend by name.
Thanksgiving and the December holiday season are prime time for breakups, studies have shown.
