Dwight Yorke: 'Aston Villa showed passion in Leicester City win'

Former Aston Villa striker Dwight Yorke believes that his former club's performance in the second half of their victory over Leicester City is the way they need to play this season.

Paul Lambert's men recorded just their second win of the campaign at Villa Park, as they came from behind to beat the Foxes thanks to a goal from Ciaran Clark and a second-half strike from Alan Hutton.

"If I was Paul Lambert I would look at the second-half video and say, 'that's the way Villa should play to get the Villa faithful back at the stadium and enjoying football once again'," Yorke told Sky Sports News.

"They had more of a go and it showed in the possession, passing accuracy and all the stats. That's what Villa need to show a lot more of at home to get the fans back here, to get the fans back on their side; that's the sort of encouragement they need to see."

Villa moved to 11th in the Premier League with the victory, and are now six points clear of the relegation zone.
