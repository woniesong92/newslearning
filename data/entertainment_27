'Jurassic World' trailer is here and dino-mite!

It's like we get to relive a little part of our childhoods -- but with the latest technology and special effects! 

The trailer for "Jurassic World" is here, and it promises a new adventure on the same dino-packed island.

The fully operating dinosaur theme park that John Hammond envisioned in "Jurassic Park" is up and running and two brothers are sent off to the park. 

Apparently, no one learned anything from the failed "Jurassic Park," because they are still messing with dino DNA. 

"You just went and made a new dinosaur? Probably not a good idea," Chris Pratt's character says in the trailer. Do we sense foreshadowing?

Of course, things quickly go very wrong, and this new, "highly intelligent" dinosaur starts terrorizing the park. 

The plot the trailer describes seems eerily similar to the original, but that hasn't made Twitter any less excited about it.
