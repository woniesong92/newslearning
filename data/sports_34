Ducks¡¯ Kyle Palmieri Scores OT Winner On Perfectly Aimed Shot (Video) 

The Anaheim Ducks are on fire, and Kyle Palmieri is fanning the flames. The Ducks¡¯ three-game winning streak was on the line Sunday when they entered overtime against the Winnipeg Jets at MTS Centre. Palmieri delivered big time in the extra period, giving Anaheim the win with an expertly placed goal from the left side. Getzlaf created the play off a long breakout pass from defenseman Hampus Lindholm, protecting the puck while he waited for Palmieri to catch up on the play. The 23-year-old right winger¡¯s body was perpendicular to the goal when he fired the puck past Jets goaltender Ondrej Pavelec. Getzlaf picked up his third assist of the game on the play. Palmieri has three points ? one goal and two assists ? in his last two games. He has six points in 11 games played this season, after missing time with an injury. The Ducks hope to further extend their hot streak Wednesday night against the Edmonton Oilers at Honda Center.
