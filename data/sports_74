Bristol's Judd Trump has been beaten to the UK Snooker Championship by Ronnie O'Sullivan in a nail-biting finish. The 25-year-old came back from 9-4 behind but lost in the final frame 10-9.
O'Sullivan, who was playing on a broken ankle, landed his fifth UK title at York's Barbican Centre, to sit alongside his five World Championship trophies and five Masters crowns.
I can't believe I've won it. I don't want to be playing him in every final. I feel like retiring.

He's a tough opponent, he's very dynamic and very explosive. He's fearless, and he's in your face the whole time, and if you go off the boil he's on you.

I left it too late and fair play to Ronnie - he took them well in the last frame and overall he was more of a deserving winner.
