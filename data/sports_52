Why It's Time for the Saints to Start Considering Life After Drew Brees

The New Orleans Saints suffered an embarrassing 41-10 loss to the division rival Carolina Panthers on Sunday. 

The loss dropped New Orleans to 5-8 on the season, 3-4 at home. More important, however, is the fact that the loss really has to change the way the decision-makers for the Saints look at this team.

Though the Saints are still very much alive in the woeful NFC South, it is very difficult to envision this team making any sort of meaningful postseason run.

The coaching staff obviously owes it to the players and the fans to focus entirely on the immediate challenge of winning a division title. For practical purposes, however, it is time for the higher-ups to begin planning for next season and beyond.
