George and Amal Clooney's Date Night at Soho House

Newlyweds George and Amal Clooney stepped out last night in West Hollywood.
The couple, married a little over two months ago in Italy, were spotted at Soho House.
The two were first seen at the bar in the garden area, where it looked like the Oscar-winner was enjoying a beer and his attorney wife sipped on some wine.
Amal was wearing a "cute black dress" and George looked "as dapper as ever in a jacket," an onlooker tells me.
They were then joined by another couple before taking their seats for dinner.

"At one point, she rested her hand on top of his," the source said.
 All four left the members-only club at about 9:30 p.m.
George and Amal swapped vows in late September in Italy at Venice's Aman Candal Grande Hotel in front of family and friends including Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Krasinski, Emily Blunt and Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour.
Amal wore a custom-made gown by Oscar de la Renta.
About a month later, Amal's parents, Ramzi and Baria Alamuddin, hosted a lavish celebration at the Danefield House Hotel and Spa in Marlowe-on-Thames in southeast England.
George was spotted on Thursday in downtown Los Angeles filming Joel and Ethan Coen's latest comedy Hail, Caesar! The actor was dressed in a hilarious gladiator costume complete with a Caesar haircut.
