Singer Ed Sheeran has returned to number one in the UK singles chart with his track Thinking Out Loud.

The song - which has been in the top 40 for 24 weeks - first topped the chart five weeks ago after being released in June.

It pipped midweek chart leader, Union J's You Got It All, by 13,000 copies, the Official Charts Company said.

Sheeran's track was also the most-streamed song in a single week, notching up 1,672,000 audio streams.

Last week's number one, Take That's These Days, slipped to three, while Taylor Swift's Blank Space climbed from eight to four.

Olly Murs' Wrapped Up fell two spots to five.
