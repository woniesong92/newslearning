Nicki Minaj Comes Dangerously Close to a Nip Slip in These Busty Selfiesâ€”See the Pics!

Nicki Minaj brought the girls out for her Saturday Night Live rehearsals.
The female rapper has never been shy about flaunting some of her greatest assets, and such was the case today when Minaj hit Studio 8H in New York City for dress rehearsals in anticipation of tomorrow night's performance.
Nicki posted two nearly identical selfies that showed off major (like, major) cleavage while wearing a blue lace outfit that barely covered anything, and the celeb even came dangerously close to accidentally flashing some nipple.
Luckily, it looks like that crisis was averted.

"SNL REHEARSALS R GIVING ME LIFE. WATCH TMRW," she captioned one of the sexy snapshots.
This is the second time Minaj will be featured on the show as a musical guest (James Franco will host), but it seems as though viewers will see more than they bargained for from the star.
One of Nicki's tweets made it seem as though she might be included in a few sketches as well (wishful thinking?). "SNL rehearsals are reminding me so much of studying theatre in high school. Really lovin it... let's see how it'll compare 2 my last show," she tweeted today.
A couple of the duo's promos for their appearance recently hit the Internet, too. Watch the clip below to see Nicki and James spoof Peter Pan Live! and show off just how close of friends they are ahead of their big night!
