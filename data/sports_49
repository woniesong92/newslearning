Spieth blisters all-star field

WINDERMERE, FLA. ? Jordan Spieth had been down this road before.

Three years ago at Isleworth, he was making the turn in the final round when he looked over at the scoreboard on the 18th fairway that showed he had a big lead. So it was eerie when he caught himself doing the same thing Sunday during the final round of the Hero World Challenge.

But there was one big difference.

Back then, Spieth was a freshman at Texas and won by eight shots in the Isleworth Collegiate Invitational for his first college title.

This time, he beat an elite field that included tournament host Tiger Woods, six major champions and 16 of the top 30 players in the world.

And he beat them even worse.

Spieth, the Australian Open winner, capped off his second season as a pro when he closed with a 6-under 66 and set two tournament records to win by 10 shots over Henrik Stenson. Staked to a seven-shot lead in the final round, he opened with three birdies in four holes and turned the final three hours into a peaceful walk along the lakes and palatial homes of Isleworth.

¡°It was the most fun I ever had playing nine holes of golf,¡± Spieth said.

Spieth had an 11-shot lead after nine holes, ripped a drive over the corner of the bunker and then glanced at the lone leader board. And then he made another birdie. He coasted from there and even with a careless double bogey on the back nine, he finished at 26-under 262 to break the tournament record of 266 set by Woods in 2007 and Davis Love III in 2000, both at Sherwood Country Club in California.

Woods, in his first tournament in four months while recovering from back injuries, stubbed two chips on the 13th hole for a triple bogey and closed with a 72. He tied for last place in the 18-man field with Hunter Mahan, 26 shots out of the lead.
