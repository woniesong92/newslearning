SWANSEA BOSS MONK ACCEPTS WEST HAM DEFEAT

Swansea City boss Garry Monk had few complaints after their 3-1 defeat at Swansea City.

Monk, who has still only led his side to one win on the road this term, was left ruing what he felt was the worst display he had seen for some time.

"I just don't think we ever reached the levels we have done this season," he said.

"That is the first time I can say that, in all the games we have played. We did not make enough correct decisions. The only time we did that we scored the goal.

"We didn't do that enough and really some of the defending, we gifted it to them on a plate to be honest. No complaints with the result, we didn't deserve anything from the game.

"We actually had our best spell when we went down to 10 men but it shouldn't take a situation like that for us to play our best football. We gave them an early Christmas present I think."
