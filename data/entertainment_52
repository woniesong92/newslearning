Police investigating rapper Earl Hayes, VH1 star Stephanie Moseley’s deaths in apparent murder-suicide

Rapper Earl Hayes, son of Isaac Hayes, and his wife Stephanie Moseley, star of VH1 series, “Hit the Floor," were found dead in their Los Angeles apartment Monday, according to TMZ. 

The entertainment news site reported that neighbors could hear a woman screaming Monday morning and gunshots. SWAT arrived on the scene and found two bodies believed to be Hayes and Moseley. 

VH1 said in a statement the network was "incredibly saddened" at the news of Moseley's passing. 

"VH1 and the entire ‘Hit The Floor’ family send our thoughts and condolences to her family and friends at this difficult time," spokesman Chris Delhomme told Fox411.

LAPD told Fox411 that they have yet to officially confirm the identities of the deceased, but Burrel Wilks, self described life coach to Hayes, has confirmed the news to press. 

“Stephanie was exceptionally beautiful, an absolutely amazing and incredible dancer, and judging by how the other girls spoke about her, a lovely human being,” co-star Dean Cain said. “I'm heartbroken and saddened.”

Hayes was once signed to boxer Floyd Mayweather's record label and was often seen partying with the famous boxer. Before her VH1 series, Moseley had been a backup dancer for Chris Brown and Britney Spears among other performers. 

Chris Brown instagrammed a photo in memory of the dancer with a caption, “RIP baby girl. Danced with me on tour and was always the coolest person. My prayers go out to you and HAZE family."
