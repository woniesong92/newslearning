The internet went into overdrive yesterday when Brown called out his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Karrueche Tran, on social media.

On Friday, Brown reportedly told fans at a gig in Los Angeles: "Well, I'm single too. F**k that b*tch."

Tran then popped onto Twitter, writing: "N**gas be in they feelings when you break up with them lol". (sic)

Brown replied on Instagram: "I was locked up for damn near 4 months and only got 1 visit from you while u was hosting parties and taking secret trips to Toronto, going on dates with Drake!"

It's no secret that Drake and Brown both dated singer Rihanna, and that she was the source of their several bust-ups.

But Brown's revelation has introduced a new dimension to this soap opera. Drake not only dated Rihanna during a break-up from Brown but also, according to Brown, dated Tran when he was in prison.
