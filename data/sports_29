10-for-10 for Big Ten teams in bowl games

DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) ? Every bowl-eligible team in the Big Ten will go to the postseason after all.
The league had 10 eligible teams, but was at risk of filling just nine spots if Michigan State had been picked for the Orange Bowl. But Mississippi State earned the nod over the Spartans by finishing a spot ahead of them in the final playoff rankings.
That in turn opened up a spot for the Big Ten in the Citrus Bowl.
Michigan State will now face Baylor in the Cotton Bowl, while Minnesota will play Missouri in the Citrus.
The program that appeared to be in the most peril was Illinois, which finished just 6-6. But the Illini are in the Heart of Dallas bowl against Louisiana Tech.
