49ers vs. Raiders: Full Report Card Grades for San Francisco

The San Francisco 49ers dropped a 24-13 loss to the Oakland Raiders in Week 14, which might have put a cap on any hopes for head coach Jim Harbaugh's squad to return to the playoffs for the fourth-straight season.

Yet the loss indicated so much more than dwindling postseason hopes. In reality, it highlighted a season-long struggle on offense. It reinforced thoughts that Harbaugh will not be in San Francisco for the final year of his contract in 2015. Questions will surround whether or not quarterback Colin Kaepernick is progressing at all this year.

Oakland entered the contest with a 1-11 record and had recently been handled by the St. Louis Rams 52-0 in Week 13. San Francisco was trying to correct things after an embarrassing 19-3 loss to the Seattle Seahawks during the same week.

The Raiders did what they needed to do to upset the 49ers' chances. San Francisco looked all but defeated from the third quarter onward.


In all, the 49ers offense mustered just 248 yards and just 13 points. This game marked the fourth-consecutive contest in which San Francisco generated fewer than 17 points. Needless to say, the grades for each unit?particularly on offense?will not be pretty.

Grades are issued based on statistics, in-game impact and how each unit affected the outcome.

But for the 49ers, it will be hard to find many positives emanating out of this rough loss.
