Genetic tests confirm remains are those of King Richard III

DNA evidence has finally confirmed that remains found beneath a parking lot in Leicester, England, are those of King Richard III. The genetic analysis suggests that the king had blond hair and blue eyes, a description that matches portraits of the 15th century monarch.

Comparing the skeleton's genetic material with samples from two of Richard III's living relatives also revealed a perfect match in mitochondrial DNA. However, there was no Y-chromosome match between the skeletal remains and five males who were considered relatives of the king based on genealogy. 

This genetic evidence lays to rest a 527-year missing person case but raises questions about whether several kings, including Henry IV and possibly the Tudors, had legitimate claims to the throne, researchers write December 2 in Nature Communications.
