Greenhouse gases changed Africa climate: Study

A rise in the volume of greenhouse gas emissions had likely affected the rainfall patterns and Africa's overall climate 10,000 years ago, a study shows.

The result of the study, which was funded by the US National Science Foundation and the US Department of Energy Scientists, is important as it links the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to evolving and changing climate and weather patterns.

“This study is important not only because it explains a long-standing puzzle, but it helps to validate model predictions of how rising greenhouse gas concentrations might change rainfall patterns in highly populated and vulnerable parts of the world,” said Peter Clark, a paleoclimatologist at Oregon State University and co-author of this particular study.

The research findings also indicate that carbon dioxide and several other greenhouse gases might have harshly affected the mysterious amount of rainfall in some regions of Africa throughout a period which lasted 10,000 years.

The findings also indicate what would happen to Africa and other parts of the world in decades to come.

Now scientists have more solid evidence supporting the overall climatic changes which greenhouse gases may cause.
