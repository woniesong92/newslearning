Chargers DB Darrell Stuckey scores 53-yard TD vs. Patriots

Chargers defensive back Darrell Stuckey recovered a fumble Sunday and returned it 53 yards for a touchdown in his team's 23-14 loss to the Patriots in Week 14.

The Patriots faced a third-and-short from midfield and completed a pass to Brandon LaFell, who fumbled the ball while crossing the first-down marker. Stuckey picked the ball up and took it the other way to give the Chargers a 14-3 lead, with the play standing on review. However, the offense was unable to score again and the defense couldn't keep the Patriots at bay for the entire 60 minutes. The Chargers face another tough test in Week 15 when they face the Broncos.
