Russell Wilson, Marshawn Lynch, Doug Baldwin's Post-Week 14 Fantasy Reaction

The Seattle Seahawks defense shined brightest during an impressive Week 14 win against the Philadelphia Eagles, but the offense likely led to plenty of fantasy playoff victories.

Russell Wilson and Doug Baldwin were especially productive, taking advantage of a weak Eagles secondary en route to big days:

Week 14 vs. Philadelphia Eagles

Wilson's throwing can sometimes be slightly inconsistent, but his ability to carve up huge chunks on the ground makes him one of the safer fantasy options under center. Against a reeling San Francisco 49ers team at home in Week 15, he's a definite QB1.

Baldwin is bit more difficult to trust. Although he is the team's clear No. 1 receiving option, he is erratic due to Wilson's propensity to spread the ball around?and Seattle's run-heavy attack. His production on Sunday (97 yards) trumped that of his previous three weeks combined.

Treat him as a flex option in deeper leagues, but that's about it.

Seeing very few running lanes, Marshawn Lynch had to work a bit harder for his yards, but he still found a way to produce:

Week 14 vs. Philadelphia Eagles

Although Beast Mode has been a bit banged up, he still gets tons of carries, is very involved in the passing game and is one of the most impressive runners in the league. He went for 104 yards against the Niners on Thanksgiving, and he'll be a high-end RB1 against them next week.
