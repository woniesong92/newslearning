Carbon supplants silicon in electronic medical sensors

BOSTON — Going organic isn’t just for produce anymore — it’s all the rage in flexible electronics. Electronic medical devices constructed from carbon-based components — the materials scientist’s definition of organic — are cheap, bendable and friendlier to the body than the old standby silicon.

Researchers discussed several such organic devices December 2 at the Materials Research Society meeting, including a sensor that detects muscle contractions and one that monitors a person’s pulse and blood oxygen levels.

Their versatile qualities make organic electronics ideal for such medical applications, says bioelectrical engineer Annalisa Bonfiglio of the University of Cagliari in Italy. “It’s a radical new world relative to silicon electronics,” she says.
