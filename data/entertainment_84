Perri, Jr. said the 40-year-old rapper had just returned home from dropping his kids off at school when he came upon the fight near his house. The attorney said it appears Sigel was an unintended victim in the shooting.
"The whole thing is a tragedy," a cousin of Sigel's wife told the Philadelphia news station. "It's just very sad and I just ask that everybody keep our family in prayer and that he pulls through."
According to local reports, the investigation surrounding the shootingl in Atlantic County was being hampered by a lack of cooperation from potential witnesses and relatives, police said. A man who was wounded in the attack was also uncooperative.
Sigel was recently released from a Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia after spending nearly a year and a half behind bars for drug possession.
