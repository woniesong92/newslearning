Jasmine wants issue with Daniel to stop

Speaking on “The Buzz” on Sunday, Curtis-Smith said she no longer wants to say anything more about the issue because it will only “get out of control.”

“I just really want to say that out of respect for everyone that’s involved in this issue, be it myself, Kathryn or Daniel, or Sam, my family, I’d rather stop talking about it because I know that the more we comment, the more it becomes a bigger issue and it just gets out of control,” she said.

“I really don’t want the fans to be fighting, or even my family to be giving comments na we can just avoid na lang. For me, I think it’s just better to give our attention to more important things,” she added.

Curtis-Smith earlier admitted exchanging text messages with Padilla, but emphasized that she is not romantically involved with the actor.

The two met as co-stars in the upcoming biopic "Bonifacio: Ang Unang Pangulo."

Curtis-Smith is currently in a relationship with singer Sam Concepcion, while Padilla is the love team partner and rumored boyfriend of actress Kathryn Bernardo.
