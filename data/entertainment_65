In fact, only one beautiful lady stood before Banks as ANTM entered its two-episode finale.

Would a man finally be on top? (Spoiler warning: The following post contains details about ANTM‘s cycle 21 finale. Stop reading now if you haven’t seen the episode.)
The cycle’s penultimate episode saw frat boy Adam rally to take the top photo for a second week in a row.

With three very different models, who would smize his way to victory? Texan dance instructor Will, who struggled with his competitors’ biases against a gay guy potentially taking the title? Athletic, seductive Keith, who was competing in honor of his late father? Or Adam, the strong, screaming type who had run afoul of Tyra after she smelled alcohol on his breath at judges’ panel?
