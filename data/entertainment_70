Bria Murphy, Eddie Murphy's Daughter, Wears Nipple Pasties in New Movie Drive, She Said—See the NSFW Photo!

Eddie Murphy's 25-year-old daughter, model Bria Murphy, just filmed one of her most high-profile acting projects alongside some familiar faces...and it's quite risqué!
The model and actress, as well as High School Musical alum Ashley Tisdale, 29, and British actress Janet Montgomery play prostitutes in the new independent comedy film Drive, She Said, which also stars American Pie and Orange Is the New Black star Jason Biggs and his real-life wife Jenny Mollen as a married couple, The Hollywood Reporter said on Friday. E! News has obtained an exclusive photo of Bria in character, wearing crimson nipple pasties.
Drive, She Said, which recently wrapped production in Los Angeles, is based on the true life story of married writers and directors Joe Syracuse and Lisa Addario. Biggs' and Mollen's characters are expecting their first child and after failing to land a job in his field, so he ends up working as a chauffeur to prostitutes, the outlet reported, adding that the events in the film take place over the course of one night.
Syracuse and Addaro also penned the script for the 2012 Billy Crystal and Bette Midler comedy movie Parental Guidance.
