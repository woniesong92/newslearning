Jessica Simpson Professes Her Love for Carpet (Seriously) in Seductive Instagram Pose—Take a Look!


Jessica Simpson has plenty of love in her life.
Between her husband, two kids and a bustling fashion empire, the 34-year-old has so much to be thankful for. But with everything that exists in her beautiful world, the blond beauty apparently has a deep appreciation for carpet too. Let us explain.
On Saturday afternoon, Mrs. Eric Johnson took to Instagram to share quite the interesting photo.
Wearing black heels, leggings and a matching sweater, Simpson glared into the camera without any smile whatsoever. That black nail polish didn't exactly brighten things up either.
But while fans may have been intrigued by her seductive pose, it was actually her caption that got people talking.
"I love carpet," she wrote on Instagram while posing on—you guessed it—carpet!

We wish we had an explanation for this photo, but instead of trying to explain it, we're just going to give kudos to that amazing body that is on display once again.
After admitting to feeling "more comfortable in my skin," the businesswoman proved she hasn't let the holidays spoil her flattering figure.
Besides, it's not about the number on the scale that determines whether or not Simpson feels sexy. It's the people around her.
"I feel sexier as a wife and a mom," she recently shared with Access Hollywood. "[Marriage] has actually changed my style. I'm really into slip-dresses and everything a little bit sexier."
Whatever the case may be, Simpson continues to look beautiful. Keep it up, girl!
