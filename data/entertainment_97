Robert Pattinson Watched FKA Twigs' Art Basel Performance From Backstage, Looked "Besotted"

Props to Robert Pattinson for being a loving, supportive boyfriend!
The 28-year-old actor wanted to support girlfriend FKA Twigs Thursday when she performed at an Art Basel: Miami Beach event at the National YoungArts Foundation campus. Because the event, co-hosted by III Points, was all about the "Two Weeks" singer, a source tells E! News that Rob watched his ladylove from backstage—allowing all eyes to focus on her!
"Before the show, Rob and a group of pals hung out with FKA in her dressing room," adds an onlooker. "When she went on, he and the friends watched from backstage."

"I don't know that you really dance to her music, but Robert was swaying," says the onlooker. "It was adorable. He looked besotted with her and very proud."
Aw! He wasn't the only one either. Newly married Solange Knowles was watching from backstage, too, and according to an eyewitness she really "seemed to enjoy" the show.
Once FKA wrapped things up onstage, she came back and "greeted her group backstage," says a source. "Robert gave her a huge hug and a kiss!"

This isn't even the first time Mr. Pattinson has surprised his ladylove. A few weeks ago he came out to FKA's sold-out NYC show and presented her with a dozen red roses! They even hit up an after-party together and reportedly stayed out until around 4 a.m.
And—sorry Twi-Hards—a source recently told E! News things "are getting pretty serious" with the twosome. In a recent interview with The Guardian, FKA admitted the paparazzi presence was a bit irksome at times, but it was well worth it so that she could be with Rob, aka "the man that I love."
Swoon!
