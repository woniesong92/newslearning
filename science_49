Most precise snapshot of the universe unveiled

From a palace in Ferrara, Italy, cosmologists have unveiled the most detailed maps yet of the infant universe. The announcement, on December 1, kicked off a weeklong conference showcasing the latest findings from the European Space Agencyâ€™s Planck satellite. The new results largely confirm earlier measurements of the makeup of the cosmos, but they also rule out some ideas about dark matter, the elusive substance thought to bind galaxies together.
