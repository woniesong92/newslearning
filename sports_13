No. 1 Kentucky cruises past Eastern Kentucky 82-49


EXINGTON, Ky. (AP) - Karl-Anthony Towns scored a career-high 19 points and top-ranked Kentucky rolled to an 82-49 victory over Eastern Kentucky on Sunday night.

Two days after a hard-fought victory over No. 6 Texas, the Wildcats (9-0) had it significantly easier against the neighboring Colonels, whose campus is located about 20 miles south of Lexington. Despite making its first 3-point attempt with 2:57 remaining, Kentucky still shot 33 of 58 from the field (57 percent) and dominated almost every statistical category.

Willie Cauley-Stein added 11 points and Trey Lyles 10 points with 10 rebounds as Kentucky improved to 11-0 against EKU (4-3).

Denzel Richardson's 19 points was one of the few bright spots for the Colonels, who shot just 18 of 69 (26 percent) from the field in losing their third straight. They made just 6 of 30 3-pointers after entering the game averaging nearly 11 per game from behind the arc.
