What the Panthers said after hammering the Saints, 41-10

"I heard them boo when they didn't feel like their team executed, but I also heard them cheer when they thought our quarterback was hurt. There really is no place for that. That's something as a player you never want to see a guy get hurt. When fans are cheering because they think a guy is hurt that is disgraceful."

--Carolina Panthers linebacker Thomas Davis on the Saints fan cheering when they thought quarterback Cam Newton was injured in the second half.

"I just saw somebody push our quarterback. I thought that our guys reacted. It's unfortunate that it happened that way, but it's kind of part of the game."

--Carolina Panthers coach Ron Rivera on the first-half scuffle.


Man of Steal Problems
While it appeared the Saints became upset when Carolina quarterback Cam Newton struck a Superman pose after scoring a touchdown, he says he wasn't sure what caused the first-half scuffle.
"Well, I had no idea. There was a lot of testosterone on that field at one time, so it's bound to happen whenever you have a bunch of alphas so to speak. Somebody out there has to have a beta mentality and I don't think there were many beta's out there at the end of that one play."

--Carolina quarterback Cam Newton on what started the scuffle.

"It's a great thing, just knowing the game is on your back. You have to go out there and make another man move from Point A to Point B to get the job done. That's what we are doing and it's just a great feeling."

--Carolina Panthers right guard Trai Turner on run blocking and running the ball with efficiency.

"That is what Coach can do. When you execute it's fun to watch and when you don't it's hard to watch."

--Panthers quarterback Cam Newton on the seven-play, 80-yard opening drive that resulted in their first touchdown.
