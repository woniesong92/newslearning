So...the Trailer for Lifetime's Whitney Houston Movie Looks Good?!

The first trailer for Lifetime's Whitney, the buzzed about Whitney Houston biopic is here! And…it looks, well, good.
Directed by Angela Bassett, yes the American Horror Story and What's Love Got to Do With It star, with America's Next Top Model veteran and Lee Daniels' The Butler actress Yaya DaCosta as the iconic singer and Arlen Escarpeta as Bobby Brown, the movie charts Houston's climb to the top of the charts and her tumultuous relationship with Brown. It looks like the flick will not shy away from the drug abuse either.

Bassett told E! News she hopes viewers come away from the movie with a deeper understanding about love.
"I think we as fans, audience…those that looked on—we thought we had some say in it. We really didn't have any say in their love affair," she said. "The say we have is of ourselves and our capacity to love, to love ourselves, to love one another and to just spread more love and joy in this world," Bassett said. "But we really thought we had a say in their love affair…I think it's a magnificent journey and I hope it will be a reflection into our own lives."
Bassett and Houston starred in Waiting to Exhale together.
The trailer features good times, bad times and the music of Houston, but that's not her singing voice. Grammy nominee Deborah Cox provides the voice for DaCosta's portrayal of Houston.
