Merry Christmas! J.K. Rowling Releasing 12 New Harry Potter Surprises in December for the Holidays

Sorry, partridge in a pear tree. You've been bumped.
J.K. Rowling just gifted her rabid fans with the best present of all: 12 new Harry Potter items for the 12 days of Christmas.
Starting Dec. 12, every day at 1 p.m. London time, "brand new writing by J.K. Rowling and even a new potion or two" will pop up on the fan-tastic Pottermore website, read a newsletter sent to members today.
At least some of the new bits and bobs will focus on Draco Malfoy, Harry's platinum-haired, Slytherin-residing school rival, and then...surprise after surprise will unfold!

Somehow, we're starting to get the feeling that Rowling is having a lot more trouble detaching herself from the Hogwarts world than she thought she would as she embarked on new, more general-audience fiction.
She released an in-depth treatise on the villainous Dolores Umbridge on Halloween, also via Pottermore, and Rita Skeeter's "coverage" of the Quidditch World Cup, published back in July, also served as a much-needed fix for those jonesing for more on how Harry, Ron and Hermione turned out.
