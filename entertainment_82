2015 Grammy Nominations for Album of the Year Revealed!

Things were a bit different this year when it came to releasing the nominations for the 2015 Grammys.
Instead of revealing all of the nominees at once, the nods for different categories were revealed throughout the day via Twitter, and culminated with the announcement of the contenders for Album of the Year contenders on A Very Grammy Christmas, which aired on CBS tonight.
The pre-taped telecast, hosted by LL Cool J, included performances by Pharrell Williams, Ariana Grande, Tim McGraw, Maroon 5, Mary J. Blige and Sam Smith.
"What we wanted to do is add a twist," Grammys longtime executive producer Ken Ehrlich told the crowd at the Shrine Auditorium ahead of the taping. "And everyone loves Christmas specials."
