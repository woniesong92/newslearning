Ariana Grande Reveals Her Favorite Moments of 2014â€”Yes, Big Sean Is One of Them (Aw!)

Ariana Grande had a pretty amazing 2014 so far.
As we near the beginning of 2015, the 21-year-old Billboard Women in Music honoree reflected on her monumentous year that proved to be fruitful in both her professional and personal life.
When it came to sharing her favorite moments from this year, Ariana told Billboard magazine (which first appeared in the Dec. 12 issue of Billboard), "Performing on the [MTV Video Music Awards] with Jessie J and Nicki Minaj. Putting out 'Problem.' Spending half of June and most of July with my family in Florida. And, um, [boyfriend Big] Sean."
Awww, that's precious!

The young singer released her sophomore LP, My Everything, this past August, and made Billboard Hot 100 history by becoming one of a group of female solo artists to control the top five positions for six consecutive weeks.
"A year-and-a-half ago I was wearing a red wig, pretending to be a silly 15-year-old on a television show," Grande said, referring to her title role as Cat Valentine on the Nickelodeon sitcom Sam & Cat.
"Now I'm in that company," marvels Grande. "It's kind of ridiculous."
Some more highlights from her big year: scoring three top 10 hits on the Hot 100 in the same week, becoming the first woman to top the Billboard Artist 100, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with My Everything and adopting four rescue puppies. "I feel like Ace Ventura when I wake up," she joked.
