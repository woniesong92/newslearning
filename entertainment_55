John Legend & Chrissy Teigen Hire Food Trucks To Feed Hungry NYC Protesters

Musician John Legend and his wife, model Chrissy Teigen, have come out to vocally support the protesters in New York, and now it appears they are putting up their own money to prove it.

Protesters have been demonstrating in the streets of New York city for days now, voicing their opposition to the Eric Garner and Ferguson, Mo. Grand Jury decisions. To feed the hungry protesters, it has been reported that Legend and Teigen hired a slew of food trucks to pass out meals to demonstrators and New York City's homeless on Sunday.

Teigen also retweeted a post from Operation Help or Hush – a Twitter-based activism organization – which listed the location of the food trucks.

Operation Help or Hush began tweeting the locations of the food trucks early Sunday morning, and soon began retweeting hundreds of messages of support from protesters who appreciated the warm meals and support.
