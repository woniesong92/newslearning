Yannick Bolasie keen on Crystal Palace stay

Yannick Bolasie has insisted that he has no intention of leaving Crystal Palace any time soon.

The in-form winger stole the headlines for a dazzling performance in Saturday's 0-0 draw with Tottenham Hotspur, prompting speculation that a January move could be on the cards.

However, Bolasie, 25, says that he is fully focussed on helping the Eagles - who sit one point above the relegation zone - stay in the Premier League.

"I am happy at Palace," Bolasie told BT Sport. "It is all about progressing.

"I am improving every week at Palace. I want to make sure I have another good season and keep Palace up.

"If we play like that every week [we will stay up]. Spurs are a top club and if we play like this against teams like Stoke, we will be okay."

The Democratic Republic of the Congo international is contracted to the London club until 2017.
