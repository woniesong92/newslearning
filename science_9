Magnetic Filed of The Moon Used To Be Much Higher

Soon after scientists reviewed the samples collected by the Apollo astronauts, they claimed that the magnetic field of the moon used to be much higher than the earth’s present magnetic field. Researchers said that the moon’s magnetic field might have been as strong as 70 microteslas while earth has relatively less strength of 50 microteslas, and presently the moon does not have a global magnetic field.

Benjamin Weiss, the study co-author, said: “Earth’s magnetic field is currently 50 microteslas in strength. The early moon may have had a magnetic field that was bigger, maybe up to more than 70 microteslas”.

The question now is how could the moon have such a high magnetic field and why did it end. Weiss and Sonia Tikoo, who had their study published in Journal Sciences, suggest that the magnetic field of the moon can be the result of the molten liquid core that our satellite had.

They postulated that the planets move electrically conducting fluids around themselves, thus generating magnetic fields through a process which they compared to a dynamo, with earlier scientists not even knowing whether the moon generated the magnetic filed itself or if it was due to the outside forces.

For the past six years, scientists have been using new and advanced search methods to try hard to discover strong signals that the moon might have had a magnetic core of its own. Researchers say that if the moon had a similar internal dynamo, it would allow them to better understand its inner structure, which has for long baffled scientists.

Researchers after several conducting several studies could not say why the moon actually stopped producing the magnetic field and are perplexed as to how the relatively small core of the moon could generate such a strong magnetic field.
