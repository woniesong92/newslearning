"I've never played by myself on a stage before and U've never played a song that I've only played in my living room before, so I'm a little nervous," she said standing before her audience in a sparkling silver wig. 

She explained the song had been inspired by dreams the night her friend's cat died, saying, "I feel like her cat kind of told me what I was supposed to say to get her through it... It was more therapy to me than anything."
