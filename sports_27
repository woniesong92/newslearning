Senators rally, beat Canucks in OT to snap skid

OTTAWA (AP) ? Erik Karlsson scored 1:21 into overtime to give the Ottawa Senators a 4-3 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on Sunday night.

Mike Zibanejad had two goals and two assists, David Legwand also scored and Craig Anderson stopped 30 shots for the Senators. Ottawa rallied from three goals down to snap a five-game losing streak (0-4-1).

Radim Vrbata, Kevin Bieksa and Brad Richardson scored for Vancouver, and Eddie Lack had 41 saves.


The Senators' comeback bid started midway through the second as Legwand scored a power-play goal with 9:07 remaining in the period. Zibanejad made it 3-2 with 5:48 left as he picked up his own rebound and banked it in off Yannick Weber, and then tied with 1:02 left in the period with a backhand past Lack.

Vancouver opened the scoring at 6:10 of the first as Vrbata had a nice deke to get around Anderson and score into an open net.

Just over one minute later Bieksa made it 2-0 as his shot from just inside the blue line made it through traffic.

Richardson scored at 5:02 of the third to put the Canucks up 3-0.

Mark Stone returned to the lineup after missing one game after taking a puck to the ankle against the Islanders last Thursday.
