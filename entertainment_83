2015 Grammy Awards: Check Out the Complete List of Nominees

Some artists made the Recording Academy so "Happy" this year!
Pharrell, Beyoncé and Sam Smith lead the field of nominees for the 57th Annual Grammy Awards with nods apiece, including Album of the Year, for which they'll square off against Beck and Ed Sheeran.
Producer Tom Coyne has five nominations for his work with Beyoncé, Smith and Taylor Swift (1989 missed the 2014 cutoff, so don't worry, she wasn't snubbed), and close at the leaders' heels are Iggy Azalea, Beck, Eric Church, Drake, Gordon Goodwin, Jay Z, Miranda Lambert, Sia, Usher and Jack White with four nods each.
The 2015 Grammys air Feb. 8 on CBS from Los Angeles' Staples Center. Here is the complete list of nominees:
