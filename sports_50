Baxter: Stars shine in state title games

THE WEEKEND OF Champions is over, with the Class 3A, Class 4A Div. I, and Class 4A Div. II champions being crowned.

Here¡¯s a look at the Blitz¡¯s all-WOC honors:

TOP COACH: Greg Porter, Hillcrest. Difficult to argue with a 47-17 drubbing of Dutch Fork in the 4A Div. I title game With a limited paid staff, and having to make use of volunteer coaches, the Rams rose to the occasion despite trailing early.

SURPRISE TEAM: Hillcrest. Let¡¯s face it: no one outside of Simpsonville picked it to win, but it dominated the Silver Foxes in the trenches on both sides of the ball.

TOP DEFENSE: Hillcrest. The Rams held Dutch Fork to 17 points and 134 yards of total offense. They held all-state running back Matt Colburn to 88 yards. They also scored twice from the defensive side.

TOP OFFENSE: Spartanburg. The Vikings flexed their muscles and put up 508 yards of total offense in their 4A Div. II 49-28 win over York.

QUARTERBACK: Austin Scott, Spartanburg. The junior was 16 of 22 for 320 yards and three toucdowns, and scored a rushing TD.

WIDE RECEIVER: Tavaris Scott, Spartanburg. Caught five passes for 132 yards and a TD.

OFFENSIVE LINEMAN: Daron Mullins, Spartanburg. Undersized at 5-foot-10, be he understands leverage. He did not have an errant snap and got into position quickly after the snap.

DEFENSIVE LINEMAN: Tay Scott, Hillcrest. Anchored the inside of the Hillcrest front, finishing with four tackles and a tackle-for-loss.

LINEBACKER: Louis Rogers, Spartanburg. Had seven tackles and two sacks.
