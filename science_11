Mysterious Circular image caught on Mars

During the recent observation of Mars, scientists found a series of strange and rare formations, which they cannot explain.
The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has captured a new image, which is a 1.2 mile wide circle shaped formation within the Red Planet’s Athabasca Valles region.

Astronomers have long believed that around 80 percent craters in the Athabasca Valles were secondary craters created after an unknown object impacted the Zuni crater. The Athabasca Valles is believed to have some of the youngest lava flows on Mars.

Athabasca is an outflow channel on the planet. It is said to be of Late Amazonian age and it cuts into the surface of the Red Planet by the process of catastrophic flooding. But NASA has asked people not to jump on the alien theory and that the image has a valid explanation behind it. According to the astronomers, the flow of lava and volcanoes can cause such circular, brain like patterns.

In a statement released by NASA they explained: ‘It looks like a circular island surrounded by a sea of smooth-looking lava flows. Therefore, it is highly possible that volcanism played a role in creating this feature. Perhaps lava has intruded underneath this mount and pushed it up from beneath. It looks as if material is missing from the mound, so it is also possible that there was a significant amount of ice in the mound that was driven out by the heat of the lava.’

The image was taken with the help of HiRISE camera, which are on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The camera is one of the six instruments attached to the orbiter. It has a 19.7 inch aperture telescope, which is the largest that has ever been used in any deep space mission. The resolution of the camera is 0.3MP. The 143.3 pounds camera was built by Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corp. under the guidance of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona. The camera is worth $40 million.
