Best of 2014: Kate Middleton's Most Regal Styles This Year

She may not be a queen yet, but let's just settle for this—Kate Middleton is the reigning monarch of all things polished, poised and hopelessly elegant in the realm of fashion.
Ever since her fairy tale Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen wedding gown, the Duchess of Cambridge has been exalted a royal style icon. She's consistently hit the mark from every royal occasion and red carpet event, with 2014 contending to be her best year in fashion yet. Plus, with a royal visit to New York City scheduled for tomorrow through next Tuesday, we have even more royal style moments to look forward to before 2014 is up!

Three themes sum up Kate's 2014 looks: Lacy, sheer and solid-hued. At the 2014 Wildlife Photography of the Year Awards in London, Kate redefined elegant in a powder blue, crepe Jenny Packham gown. And the deep blue tulle gown, also by Jenny Packham, that the duchess recycled for a fundraiser at the National Portrait Gallery? Nothing short of (literal) sheer perfection.
Let's not neglect one of her crowning fashion campaigns of the year—her Australian and New Zealand tour with Prince William and her sweet tot Prince George. Kate turned heads in an eye-catching Roksanda Ilincic frock in a bright yellow hue (which did not resemble a banana, Prince William) while in Sydney. Again she captivated  in vogue crowds, dressing up a vibrant red Catherine Walker coat with a Gina Foster pillbox hat.
But her winning ensembles don't end there, people—take a look at her best fashion face-off's of 2014, and vote for the winners!
