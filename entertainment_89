Beyoncé and Jay Z Celebrate Rapper's 45th Birthday in Iceland—Get the Scoop!

Beyoncé and Jay Z may favor warm weather vacations, but they switched things up for the rapper's 45th birthday celebration.
The music power couple was spotted taking in the sights in Iceland and traveling via helicopter to visit multiple tourist sites.
E! News has learned that Bey and Jay have visited the Blue Lagoon, a geothermal spa, for romantic swims and some much-needed R&R.
But their time in Iceland hasn't only been spent in the spa, the two were spotted going on a helicopter trip over an active volcano as well.
Bey definitely deserves to take a break after dropping the platinum box set version of her self-titled album just a few weeks ago.

The singer released a new track "7/11" along with an awesome video to go along with it.
And while there was initially major buzz over Bey releasing an entirely new album featuring collaborations with Pharrell Williams, Nicki Minaj, and even Justin Timberlake, it looks like the rumors were just that.
Lee Anne Callahan-Longo, general manager of Beyonce's Parkwood Entertainment, explained that a leaked track list was entirely made up.
"It's funny, I got a bunch of calls over the weekend and I would say, 'It's exciting to know people are excited,'" she said.
"Even if they're reporting it wrong, and that people would take their time to go and create a fake one-sheet—right down to using a Columbia logo on it."
