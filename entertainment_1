James Franco, Seth Rogen address Sony hack on 'SNL'

Hollywood star James Franco got help from Seth Rogen when hosting 'Saturday Night Live' over the weekend during which they addressed the latest Sony hacking scandal. 

The hacking was initially believed to be North Korea's revenge on the studio due to Kim Jong-un assassination plot in 'The Interview' before the country denied it, reported Ace Showbiz. 

"This is all just a real violation of my personal life," Franco said, before Rogen joined him on stage. Rogen said the hackers had accessed their phones and gotten hold of their private pictures. 

One photo showed the two of them cradling each other like John Lennon and Yoko Ono, and another saw them sitting naked on Santa's lap. 

Later on the show, the cast poked fun at 'Peter Pan Live!' and 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'. 

In one sketch, musical guest Nicki Minaj mocked Kim Kardashian's nude pictures. "They forgot to put the backgrounds in, so the photos are completely out of context," she said. 

The female rapper also took part in a hip-hop skit, impersonating Beyonce Knowles. She was joined by Sasheer Zamata as Rihanna, Taran Killam as Eminem, James Franco as Riff Raff, Kenan Thompson as Rick Ross, Kate McKinnon as Justin Bieber, and Jay Pharoah as Kanye West.
