The film, directed by Stephen Kijak, will feature of the original members: Nick Carter, Brian Littrell, Howie Dorough, A.J. McLean and Kevin Richardson.

 Boy band guys are now doing this ...
Littrell said his group dominated during the decade that also saw the rise of groups like *NSYNC, New Kids on the Block and 98 Degrees.
"From 1992 to 2002, we were the biggest band in the world," Littrell said. "No one thought it was going to be as big as it was. Then it just stopped. And what do you do when you're a full grown man in a boy band?"
The members have gone on to other projects, with Carter most recently teaming up with New Kids on the Block member Jordan Knight to form the duo Nick & Knight. The pair released their debut album in September.
