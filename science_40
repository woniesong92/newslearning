Ancient moon’s mega magnetic field explained

The powerful magnetic field that surrounded the fledgling moon billions of years ago probably originated from the roiling lunar interior, not asteroid impacts.

Magnetized lunar material toted back during the Apollo missions established that the moon at some point had a magnetic field. Decades after NASA’s manned moon missions, a flurry of new research shows that this ancient magnetic field lasted for more than a billion years. At one point, it was as least as strong as the one generated by modern Earth.

Reviewing this recent work in the Dec. 4 Science, planetary scientists Benjamin Weiss of MIT and Sonia Tikoo of the University of California, Berkeley conclude that this magnetic field originated from flowing material inside the moon.
