Battle of the belters: Monique vs Shaira on 'Voice PH'

MANILA -- Team Sarah's Monique Lualhati and Shaira Opsimar went against each other to prove who is the better belter as the Battle Rounds continued on "The Voice of the Philippines" on Sunday.

The two performed "Lady Marmalade," which was popularized by Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Mya and Pink for the soundtrack of the movie "Moulin Rouge."

During the rehearsals, their coach Sarah Geronimo taught them how to incorporate movements into their performance to better interpret the song.

"Sa klase ng song na meron kayo, 'Lady Marmalade,' hindi enough na magaling lang kayong bumirit. Dapat effective din kayo bilang performer. Bilang mga singers tayo, performers, para din tayong mga actors eh. Dapat nanggagaling sa loob at sa mata," Geronimo said.

"It's not just the voice anymore, it's how you move," Lea Salonga said, adding that the "sexier, more polished" performance came from Lualhati.

Bamboo agreed with Salonga, saying Lualhati was able to interpret the song better with her expressions.

Geronimo had a hard time in choosing between the two, stressing that both proved their talents well. Byt he eventually chose Lualhati, explaining that she was able to show her character through the song.

Lualhati joins professional "haranista" Jason Dy and ex-Rivermaya frontman Jason Fernandez as part of Team Sarah in the next round of the competition.
