Chris Brown, Karrueche Tran battle on Instagram

The longtime bad blood between singer Chris Brown and hip hop performer Drake appeared to boil over again over the weekend, with Brown's on-and-off girlfriend, Karrueche Tran, in the middle of it.

Friday night during a concert at The Forum in Los Angeles, Brown, 25, announced, "How many single ladies we got in here tonight?" and added, "Well, I'm single too" before adding an expletive-filled adios to an unspecified ex.

The following day, she posted a long Instagram message, saying in part: "I refuse to be repeatedly mistreated especially by someone who claims to love me. That's not love. And if that's what you define as love then I don't want it. Yes, I have not been so smart before in the past but I made a promise to be a better and stronger woman and I'm keeping that promise. If you can't love me the right way, then don't love me at all."

In a recent but undated Instagram post that appears to have since been deleted, but which was reprinted at MTV.com, Brown wrote, "We've got scars, some of them u gave me, some of them I've caused," it said in part. "That ride or die act we have been fooling the world with obviously ain't working. I was locked up for damn near 4 months and only got 1 visit from you while u was hosting parties and taking secret trips to Toronto, going on dates with Drake . . . I made it clear to the world who my girl was and made your life equal to mine even at the cost of me not focusing on my career at times."

Sunday, perhaps signaling an end to the contretemps, Brown tweeted that he wouldn't be giving anyone any publicity.
