Eagles plan to forget this one

THE EAGLES are still in pretty good shape to win the NFC East, after yesterday's 24-14 but-not-really-that-close loss to Seattle. Feel free to wonder, though, what the point would be of getting to the postseason, given the way this team has played against the league's best.

One-hundred-thirty-nine total yards yesterday, the least the Eagles have managed since Chip Kelly arrived, the least a Kelly-head-coached team has ever amassed, college or pro. If this is how your offense looks against a top defense, in December, in your stadium, where you hadn't lost since last season's playoffs, well, an Eagles trip to Seattle or Green Bay at any point in January is going to be a big boost only to the airline industry.

Pile yesterday atop what happened to the Eagles previously at San Francisco, at Arizona and at the Packers, and you have a compelling body of evidence. Are the 9-4 Eagles a pretty good, better-than-average team? Yeah, sure. Are they any more than that? Not yet. And time is fleeting.

They tried to win by hiding their quarterback yesterday, something that worked great on Thanksgiving against Dallas. The defending Super Bowl champion Seahawks were having none of that. Mark Sanchez completed 10 - yes, 10 - of 20 passes for 96 yards, two touchdowns and a stake-through-the-heart, fourth-quarter interception. LeSean McCoy, even with the healthy offensive line, was back to 2.9-yards-a-carry land; as McCoy noted afterward, it's not that fulfilling to become the franchise's all-time leading rusher on a day when you failed miserably.
