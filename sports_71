Andy Carroll determined to maintain form

West Ham United striker Andy Carroll is determined to help his side continue their fine start to the season following his match-winning display against Swansea City.

The 25-year-old scored a brace to fire the Hammers to a 3-1 victory to push them up to third place in the Premier League, and he is adamant that his side have the quality to remain in the mix for a European place.

Carroll told the club's official website: "We've gone behind in the last two games but pulled it back with two great performances. The lads are buzzing to be winning and buzzing to be in the top three.

"I think we can keep doing it all season. We've got the great players, we've got the manager, the team's just fantastic at the minute and we've just got to continue the way we are."

Sam Allardyce's men face Sunderland in their next outing in the Premier League.
