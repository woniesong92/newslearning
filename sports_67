Raiders' Sio Moore takes to Instagram, calls Colin Kaepernick a chump

During Oakland's 24-13 win over San Francisco on Sunday, Raiders linebacker Sio Moore spent a lot of time trash-talking Colin Kaepernick.

Of course, in this age of social media, the trash-talking doesn't have to end just because the game does -- and Moore seems to be well aware of that.

A few hours after the Raiders win, the linebacker took to Instagram and flat-out called Kaepernick a chump. Actually, he called Kaepernick a "Freakin chump."


That's a lot of 'likes' in only 24 minutes. Apparently, a lot of people agree with Moore.

The win over the 49ers was a big one for the Raiders. It was the first time in 14 years that the Raiders have beaten the 49ers and the first time since 1979 that they've won in Oakland.

The win was so big that the team gave coach Tony Sparano a Gatorade bath afterward.

As for Moore, he's not a one trick pony on social media. He also took to Twitter and retweeted this after the game.


That's Moore tackling Kaepernick for a seven yard loss. Kaepernick was sacked five times against the Raiders and threw two interceptions.

By the way, if Moore's name sounds familiar, it's because he also made headlines after the Raiders last (and only other) win. Moore was the guy who was dancing in celebration 13 yards behind the line of scrimmage after sacking Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith late in the fourth quarter of Oakland's first win.
